\section{Background}
\subsection{Brief Introduction to Population Protocols \cite{AspnesR2007}}
Population protocols are theoretical models for distributed computation.
The model contains a collection of indistinguishable agents.
They (the agents) carry out computation tasks through directly pair-wised interactions.
The interaction pattern of agents is unpredictable from perspective of agents themselves
but is controlled through an adversary scheduler with
